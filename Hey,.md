Hey,

I've completed setting up Sanity in your existing Gatsby project. Here’s what I’ve done:

Work Completed:

1. Sanity Setup: Installed Sanity in the project and configured the schema to support blog uploads with the required fields for displaying on the page.
2. Integration with Gatsby: Connected Sanity to the Gatsby project (gatsby-config.js) and set up automatic page generation for new blog posts based on the slug provided in Sanity CMS (gatsby-node.js).
3. Blog Templates: Created templates for the blog and blog list pages, using GraphQL to display Sanity data within the blog pages and list view, showing cards for published blogs.
4. Testing: Tested the integration locally, ensuring that newly uploaded blogs appear correctly on the page and generate blog posts as discussed.

Setup Instructions for Your Local System:

1. Install Dependencies:

- Open the project folder and run:

npm install

2. Set Up Sanity:

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the Sanity folder:

cd sanity-blog
npm install

- Deploy the Sanity GraphQL API:

sanity graphql deploy

- Deploy the Sanity Studio (provide a preferred name for the domain, e.g., [your-name].sanity.studio):

sanity deploy

3. Configure CORS and Environment Variables:

- Add your web domain to the CORS origins in the Sanity dashboard to allow access to your project.
Generate a Sanity token and add it to your .env file.

4. Run Gatsby:

- In the main project folder, start the Gatsby server:

gatsby develop

Additional Notes:

- I’ve set up a page at /sanity-blog to display all published blog cards. If you prefer this to be at the /blog route, simply copy the content to the appropriate file.

- The blog post template is located at /templates/blog-post.js.

You can now add content directly in Sanity, configure the settings, and everything should work without errors.

I've attached two videos: one showing the local setup steps and another with a live demo.

I'm here to help you anytime if needed!
