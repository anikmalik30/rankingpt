                <p> While we can make recommendations, the ad spend budget is determined by the client. We do not recommend a monthly spend of less than €500 for local businesses or €1,500 for national reach. Our fees are based on a percentage of ad spend, with a minimum monthly fee.</p>

                What is a good budget for Facebook Ads?

                <p>
                There is no specific ideal budget for Facebook ads, as it depends on your advertising goals, target audience, industry, competition, and many other factors. Ultimately, a good Facebook Ads budget supports your business goals and gives you some room to experiment and optimize your approach. Facebook offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to ad spending, so you can start with a more modest budget as you test and perfect different ad combinations to see what works and what doesn’t. Then, you can gradually increase your budget as you begin to define your best-performing campaigns.</p>

                Do Facebook advertising agencies work with small businesses?

                Yes! Facebook Ads agencies work with businesses of all sizes, but they can be especially useful for small businesses that have limited resources and advertising budgets. An agency can help you develop cost-effective, personalized ads that specifically target your ideal target audience, so your advertising dollars aren’t wasted on impersonal, generalized campaigns. Small businesses need a strong online presence to survive and thrive, and a Facebook ad agency can maximize your brand visibility and customer reach, delivering significant growth and ROI.</p>
