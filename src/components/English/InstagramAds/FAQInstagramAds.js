                <p>Ads on Instagram are the platform’s advertising content format. If you don’t already know Instagram, you should know that it is currently the most important image-based social network in the world, with around one billion unique monthly users.</p>

                <p>Instagram offers a very complete suite with different campaign and ad formats. Among them, the “story” format stands out, a recently popularized communication channel, known for the ephemeral nature of information and used monthly by more than 4 million brands.</p>

                <p>If you want to manage your ads, you can register through Instagram Business or use Meta Business Suite.</p>

                There’s no better place to get the attention of people who don’t yet know what they want or need. On Facebook and Instagram, there are endless possibilities for the audience you can reach. The number of active users is huge. Therefore, there is no better resource to be able to create a funnel from start to finish than Instagram Ads. It’s that simple.</p>

              <AccordionItemPanel>
                <p>
                Yes and no. Campaigns that are not optimized, with low relevance scores and poor targeting can be expensive. However, well-optimized campaigns can be a very profitable way to advertise. This is especially true if you are exploring a specific niche with highly relevant ad creatives.

              </AccordionItemHeading>
              <AccordionItemPanel>
                <p>Not necessarily, but many types of businesses are ideal for Instagram ads. Therefore, it is important that you talk to us about this before making a decision. Instagram ads tend to work especially well if you’re already building a positive social media presence. Often, Instagram ads are most effective when they are part of a broader marketing funnel.

                What should my budget be for Instagram ads?
                </AccordionItemButton>
              </AccordionItemHeading>
              <AccordionItemPanel>
                <p>Instagram is great because it allows you to experiment with a small budget and then scale up as needed. It’s true that Instagram (and Facebook) favors those who invest more, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start with a smaller budget. There is no specific magic amount, but allocating around €5,000 per month is a great starting point.

</p>
                <p>Note: This ad budget allows any agency or advertiser to test multiple audiences, creatives, and campaigns, as long as the offer is already converting.

              </AccordionItemHeading>
              <AccordionItemPanel>

                 <p>You should work with an agency that has experience. A full-service agency specializing in Instagram ads can do much more than you could on your own. For example, a qualified agency can be excellent at both media buying and ad creation, performing both tasks with high competence.

                Are Instagram Ads better than Google Ads?
                </AccordionItemButton>
              </AccordionItemHeading>
              <AccordionItemPanel>
              <p>The objective of Instagram ads compared to Google Ads is different; It’s not about which is better or worse. Instagram ads can be more affordable in terms of cost compared to Google Ads. Additionally, Instagram ads are often more effective for brand awareness. However, Google ads tend to be more effective for intent-based searches. Using both ad formats, taking advantage of their strengths, is the best strategy!

              <AccordionItemPanel>
              <p>Undoubtedly. People take longer to solidify their decisions than you think. Each individual who clicks on your ad is living a unique experience in which they make decisions for reasons that may not be immediately evident. Remarketing ads are the perfect opportunity to reintroduce yourself in unique ways and remember your brand.

              <p>Have a solid social media presence before publishing your ads. Take the opportunity to build a loyal audience on social media regardless of ads, and establishing a legitimate presence is a great place to start. After all, ads are not just a way to generate purchases or contacts; They are also a route to creating brand awareness and loyalty.
