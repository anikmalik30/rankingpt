                Is TikTok just for Gen Z?

                TikTok is often associated with Gen Z, as it initially gained popularity among younger users. However, the platform has evolved to appeal to a diverse audience. While a significant portion of the user base is still made up of Gen Z and Millennials, TikTok has been gaining popularity among older users and even businesses. In fact, 37.4% of TikTok users are over the age of 30.</p>

                <p>The diversity of content on TikTok, ranging from viral dance challenges to educational content and product demonstrations, allows brands to reach a wide audience beyond Gen Z. Depending on your target audience and content strategy, TikTok can be an effective platform for engaging users of all ages.</p>

                 <p>You don’t need a large following to advertise on TikTok. The platform allows you to reach a wide audience, and many successful campaigns are designed to reach users who have not yet engaged with your brand.

              <AccordionItemPanel>
              <p>Whether TikTok advertising is right for your business depends on a number of factors, including your target audience, industry and marketing goals. In general, TikTok tends to be most effective for brands that offer products with an average purchase value of under £100. However, we’ve also seen great success with brands whose products have an average purchase value of £1,000 or more, which shows that this isn’t a hard and fast rule.</p>

              <p>To determine whether TikTok advertising is a good fit for your business, it’s best to schedule a call with us to discuss your specific needs and goals!</p>

              <p>TikTok Shop can be a valuable asset to your business.</p>

              <p>With its vast user base and highly engaging platform, TikTok offers a unique opportunity to connect with potential customers. Integrating TikTok Shop into your marketing strategy can allow you to take advantage of a rapidly growing platform, reach a young audience, and ultimately boost your sales.</p>

              <p>Not only does TikTok Shop make it easy to sell products directly, but it also helps you build a deeper connection with your audience by leveraging the platform’s natural engagement. However, it’s crucial to earn your customers’ trust before you look to increase sales. Build a strong, authentic presence on TikTok, and use that connection to maximize your store’s impact.</p>
