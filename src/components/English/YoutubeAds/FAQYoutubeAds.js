                YouTubeâ€™s advertising services allow you to create and promote
                video content through different ad formats. These ads can be
                targeted based on demographics, interests and behavior.
                Advertisers bid for ad placement and the cost is based on views
                or interactions.

              A YouTube ad campaign offers several targeting options, including demographic targeting (such as age, gender, and location), interest-based targeting, and custom audience targeting. Advertisers can also use remarketing to reach users who have previously engaged with their content.

              How much does Youtube Ads cost?

            <AccordionItemPanel>
              <p>
              The cost of YouTube ads depends on the bidding strategy and ad format. TrueView ads, for example, typically operate on a cost-per-view (CPV) basis, where advertisers pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of the ad or interacts with it. Costs can vary depending on competition and targeting parameters.
