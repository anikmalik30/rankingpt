                What is international SEO?

                International SEO involves optimizing a website or blog for specific countries and regions where you intend to sell and operate. Investing in international SEO helps search engines easily identify target markets and, consequently, position your website in front of the desired audience.

                Can I rank in other countries without international SEO?

                <p>
                While a website designed for the UK market may technically rank abroad, its relevance to international markets will be compromised. To give your website the best chance of ranking highly, it is essential to invest in international SEO with a clear focus on other countries and regions.

                Is Google the only search engine to consider?

              </AccordionItemHeading>

                <p>
                Google isn’t the only search engine to consider for international SEO. While Google dominates the majority of search market share in the UK and US, in countries such as China (Baidu), Russia (Yandex) and South Korea (Naver), other search engines are more relevant. We take all of these factors into consideration when advising on how best to target your SEO efforts.

                 <p>SEO is a long-term strategy, and the best results come from consistent effort over time. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t see some positive results in the short term. Here’s a summary of what you can typically expect:</p>

                 <p><b>Initial Changes (1-3 months):</b> If your pages haven’t been optimized before, you may see some quick improvements in the first few months as you implement our technical and on-page SEO recommendations.</p>

                 <p><b>Growth Momentum (3-6 months):</b> As you add content to your site and become more credible, you’ll likely see an increase in rankings for some of your target keywords. You should also see an increase in organic traffic, unless your niche is extremely competitive.</p>

                 <p><b>Establishing Authority (6-12 months):</b> With consistent content creation and link building, your site’s authority should grow during this phase. You’ll likely see more significant improvements in search rankings, especially for competitive keywords.</p>

                 <p><b>Ongoing Development (12+ months):</b> SEO is not a “set it and forget it” strategy; it requires ongoing effort. After a year, you should see a solid increase in traffic and leads. Continued content creation, website optimization, and backlink acquisition are necessary to maintain and improve these results.</p>

                 <p>It’s worth remembering that competition, market saturation, and algorithm updates can all influence SEO results. Patience, persistence, and a willingness to adapt your strategy to search engine updates are key to long-term success.</p>
